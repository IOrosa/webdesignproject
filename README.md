Web Design Project 2019
The objective is to design and implement a web presentation of an imaginary restaurant or cafe. The presentation should contain:

A home page with several selected "featured products", special actions, etc.
A menu with several sections (food, drinks, ...). At least some items in the menu should be clickable and some detail page should be displayed (e.g. a photo of the meal, some story about it, etc.)
A photo gallery.
Contact information including the address, opening hours, parking information, etc.
... whatever you want
The presentation should be split to at least 6 documents with a reasonable information architecture. There should be at least:

A global navigation (a main menu that remains at the same positions for all the pages).
A local navigation specific for some sections (i.e. submenu).
Fixed header and footer of all the pages.
Images at least in some sections.
The page layout should contain at least two columns (e.g. a menu column, main content, news column, etc.)
The pages should be implemented in HTML 5 and the maximal use of the semantic elements (header, section, nav, etc.) and the style defined using CSS. The page layout must be defined using CSS (no tables may be used for page layout).

This is a team project. Please set up the teams of 2 or 3 members. All the HTML and CSS code must be the own work of the team members. The code may not be shared accross the teams. It is not allowed to use any third-party code (such as free templates, CSS frameworks, etc.) However, it is allowed (but not necessary) to use free JavaScript libraries (such as jQuery) and images downloaded from the web.

Presentation
The project is finished by a presentation of the result (preferably on a large screen). I will offer several possible dates of presentation during December. In special cases, individual dates may be arranged (contact me). The latest deadline is December 13
