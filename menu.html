                                <dd>Chris Cosentino braises beef shank and oxtail in red wine to make a brasato he serves with house-made mint pappardelle. This easier version uses just beef shank. Fresh pappardelle from a store replaces the house-made kind.</dd>

                                <dd>The style of this gooey lasagna is called free-form because the pasta can be arranged in different ways—for instance, folded over the filling—instead of traditionally layered.</dd>

                                <dd>There are many versions of bread soup; this one, based on traditional peasant fare, is as thick as a bread pudding. The soup is delicious on its own, but we think the steamed mussels with their broth make a wonderful addition.</dd>
                <dt>Minestra d’orzo</dt>
                                <dd>Clearly showing its Austro-Hungarian origins, barley soup or Gerstensuppe is a staple of South Tyrolean cuisine.

                    <dt>Chopped Italian Salad</dt>
                                <dd>Antipasto ingredients are sliced and diced to make a fun, flexible chopped salad. We've thrown in our favorites, and so should you. Add the dressing ingredients to the bowl, too, and mix them when you toss the salad—it's the Italian way.</dd>
                    <dt>Summer Farro Salad</dt>
                                <dd>Marco Canora says you can swap in any starch—like bread or pasta—for the farro (a nutty Italian grain) in this recipe. Canora simmers farro in water with sautéed onion, carrots and celery. The aromatic vegetables add delicate flavor to the cooked grains.</dd>
                    <dt>Warm Castelfranco with Vincotto and Blu di Bufala</dt>
                                <dd>This simple and magical combination of ingredients from Carlo Mirarchi includes Castelfranco (a mild radicchio), vincotto (aged vinegar) and the superb blue cheese blu di bufala. It’s a very Italian dish, but Carlo Mirarchi gives it a personal imprint by adding fish sauce to the dressing.</dd>

                    <dt>Arrosticini – Abruzzese lamb skewers</dt>
                                <dd>This arrosticini recipe makes a sublime barbecue dish for summer. These simple lamb skewers frequently grace dinner tables in the region of Abruzzo, which is famous for its host of lamb dishes.</dd>

                                <dd>This agnello cacio e ova recipe is a truly unique dish hailing from Abruzzo, where lamb is the king of meats. It's best to think of this as a kind of lamb carbonara – aim to emulsify the egg with the cheese over a moderate heat without scrambling the egg and you'll have a lovely rich sauce.</dd>

                                <dd>There are few sights more welcoming than a plate of fish with gleaming, golden skin, making this stunning seafood recipe the perfect dish to delight your guests. Matteo Metullio's pan-fried cod fillet recipe is served atop a mound of creamy polenta mousse, which in turn is studded with crisp fried capers, candied tomatoes and succulent slices of anchovy.
